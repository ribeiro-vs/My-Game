# My-Game - JUMPER

This project is nothing but a game called JUMPER that I created when I was starting at Unity 3D in 2020. The download is safe, and the project is simple but also fun.

The objectives in this game are very straightforward. Your only goal will be to advance through all the levels by jumping over the green platforms and trying to avoid the floor.
The game is composed of 7 levels, and the difficulty of the levels will increase as you advance in the game.
