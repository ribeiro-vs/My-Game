# JUMPER

JUMPER is a simple yet fun platformer game that I developed when I first started learning Unity 3D in 2020. It was created using C# and object-oriented programming principles, making it a great introduction to game development.

The gameplay is straightforward: your goal is to jump across green platforms while avoiding the floor. The game consists of 7 levels, with increasing difficulty as you progress, providing a challenge while keeping the mechanics simple and engaging.

Below are some screenshots showcasing the game:

While the visual and sound effects are simple, they effectively enhance the gaming experience.
