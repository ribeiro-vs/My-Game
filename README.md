# My-Game - JUMPER

This project is nothing but a game called JUMPER that I created when I was starting at Unity 3D in 2020. The download is safe, and the project is simple but also fun.

The objectives in this game are very straightforward. Your only goal will be to advance through all the levels by jumping over the green platforms and trying to avoid the floor.

The game is composed of 7 levels, and the difficulty of the levels will increase as you advance in the game.

Down below, you can have a look of what the game is like:

The visual and sound fx in the game are pretty simple, but they work effectively. When dying, you'll hear a specific sound, and when you reach the green platform successfully making it to the next stage you'll listen to another sound. 

Although a warning message might appear when downloading the game, the download and installation of the game are completely safe.
